# Oneliner

All the relevant code is in the `/components/` and `/src/` directories. The rest of it was generated for the purpose of demonstration. To use them, you should copy these folders to your project.

There are two components: OnelinerHTM and OnelinerSVG, the latter being preferred. OnelinerHTM can have arbitrary html as children, while OnelinerSVG only SVG children.
